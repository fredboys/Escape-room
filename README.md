# Escape Room 

This is a booking application for an escape room company. If the consumer would like to have some fun by trying to complete an escape room they can browse the site where they will find all the rooms available to play, be able to create an account and complete a booking of their chosen date and time and a dashboard for the user to manage all of their bookings. The admin can view all bookings to see the upcoming bookings they have for the days ahead with all information provided.
